Predicting sales of a retail giant using time series forecasting method
Global Mart is an online supergiant store that has worldwide operations. This store takes orders and delivers across the globe and deals with all the major product categories — consumer, corporate & home office.
Now, due to certain unpredictable circumstances in the market, as a company, you are prioritizing only the best and most consistent market segment in terms of profitability. You want to see which market segment is the most consistently profitable. And then, you want to forecast the sales for that most consistently profitable market-segment only. This way you know that the market region your company is investing in will be beneficial for the company as the forecasts will be reliable. As of now, you do not want to focus on other market segments that might have not been very consistent and profitable to your company.

 

So, not all of these 21 market segments are important from the store’s point of view. You need to find out the most consistently profitable market-segment from the above and forecast the sales and demand for that single market-segment only and not for all.
